# Alternative Frequency Piano

Have you ever wondered what it's like to hear a piano tuned to something other than `A440`? I bet you haven't, but since there isn't a way to do this online yet why not give it a shot.

## What is this?
Instruments are typically tuned to a set of frequencies based around the A note above middle C being tuned to a frequency of `440 hertz`. Some artists choose to tune their instruments based around other frequencies, for example `432 hertz`. 

## Why did I build this?
Nothing on the web, besides this site, allows you to actually experiment with different frequencies. Lots of resources exist that either explain what an aternative tuning is, or shows examples.

I was writing a cover of "Last Christmas" by "WHAM!", when I noticed that none of the notes I played sounded correct even though my guitar was in tune. I had no easy way to attempt to figure out if "Last Christmas" was tuned to A440 like almost every other song.
